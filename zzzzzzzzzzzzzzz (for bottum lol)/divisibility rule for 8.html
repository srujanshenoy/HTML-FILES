    <h1>Divisibility rule for 8</h1>
    <p>If you divide a number by 8 and you get a whole number as an answer</p>
    <p>(quotient), then that number is divisible by 8.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Instead of simply dividing your number by 8 to see if you get a whole</p>
    <p>number, you can use what we call the Divisibility Rule for 8.</p>
    <p>The Divisibility Rule for 8 is used to determine if a number is divisible by</p>
    <p>8. You can also call it the test of divisibility for 8.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>A number is divisible by 8 if the hundreds digit is even and the last two</p>
